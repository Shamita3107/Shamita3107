# About Me 😁
I am still exploring my career pathway, as my journey in this course has only just begun. However, I have developed a clear vision of potential future roles, including Bioinformatics Scientist, Data Scientist, Analyst, and Molecular Biologist. I am currently seeking opportunities to deepen my understanding of the field I am studying. As a motivated and eager-to-learn student, I would greatly appreciate any additional courses, training programs, or learning opportunities offered by companies that could help me grow and gain practical experience.
